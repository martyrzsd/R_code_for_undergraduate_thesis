# R_code_for_undergraduate_thesis
code for undergraduate thesis

This is the code part of my undergraduate thesis. 
Our work includes a review in recent progress of using random matrix theory to correct likelihood ratio test and an further study into random matrix theory, particularly the central limit law for linear spectral statistics of covariance matrix and Fisher matrix. 
We also conducted several numerical experiments using current methods on different structued problem, particularly when there are extra sparsity in our model. 
We evaluated their performance under such settings and hopefully can obtain an usable package.
